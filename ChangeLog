   author of R/qtl.
2012/10/31 copy 'ks.c' from 'stats' in R-2.15.1 to avoid a harsh warning
   in R CMD CHECK when functions pkolmogorov2x and psmirnov2x are called
   from 'stat' by '.C'; filled in a missing sex value in pedF8 in the miscEx
   example data.

   allelic effects, plus some other minor changes.
2011/09/30 allow user to interrupt of 'cic' in addition to other conveniences.

   on macosx and solaris systems.
2011/03/10 replace scanOne with scanOne4p; add functions to calculate identity
   coefficients from pedigrees; add a function to create matrices that are
   associated with non-genetic random effects.
2010/11/10 remove "R (>= 2.9.0)".
